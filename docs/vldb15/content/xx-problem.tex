\section{Problem Statement}



\paragraph{Definition 1 (Database, State, Query)}: Let $D$ be a database with a
set of relational schemas named as $\{R1, ..., Rn\}$. A state of $D, D_i$,
is an instance of $D$ consists of values of all the tuples in D. The
initial state of $D$ is $D_0$. Let $Q_{seq}=\{Q1,..., Qm\}$ as a sequence of
queries over $D$ such that the state of $D$ changes to $\{D1,..., Dm\}$.


\paragraph{Definition 2 (Complaint, Complete Complaint Set, Incomplete
Complaint Set)}:
Given a database D, a complaint c={t, trevised}provides an incorrect
record (tuple) tD on an instance of Di, and the correct value,
trevised, of this record. Let C={c1,...,ck} as a set of complaints,
we say Cis a complete complaint set if there exists a complaint
cjC for every incorrect record in Di; otherwise, we say Cis a
incomplete complaint set. A complaint set Cchanges the state of D
from Di to Di*.

\paragraph{Problem definition}: Given a database D, its initial
state D0, a sequence of queries Qseq={Q1,..., Qm}and the corresponding
states {D1,..., Dm}, a complete(incomplete) complaint set  Con Dm
(that changes the state of D to Dm*), we want a transformation
(delete/swapping/update), T, changes Qseqto Qseq* such that the
final state of D change from Dmto Dm*. We say  Qseq*is optimal when
diff( Qseq, Qseq*) is minimized.
