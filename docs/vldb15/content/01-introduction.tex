\section{Introduction}

While exploring data, its natural to come across surprising or unexpected data.
For example, visual data analysis explores the current state of the database and users may be surprised by outliers in a visualization.
Similarly, enterprise customers (e.g., billing) may find outliers in their monthly bills and be surprised by the amount they are asked to pay.

A recent wave of research has been focused on deriving explanations that describe influential factors of outliers of aggregaito queries.
However, this line of work is focused on the {\it current state} of the database, and does not resolve {\it how} the anomalous data came to be.


A paragraph about possible alternative .pproaches to explaining and dealing with outliers.

In this paper, we approach anomaly explanation from the persepctive of the query log and seek to
both {\it identify}  historical database modification queries that most likely caused user complaints 
in the current state of the database, and suggest replacement queries that will resolve these complaints.
